title: A morte Zoom. Un auspicio.

> We, here at Input, use Zoom every day. It was fun for the first few weeks of lockdown. Like everyone sheltering in place, we made the best of things. We voluntarily turned our webcams on. We had virtual happy hours. We laughed at each other’s beards and unkempt hair.
> 
> It was harmless until I realized what a shitty company Zoom is with shitty practices. Shitty with security. Shitty with privacy. Shitty in every way because the people who work there don’t seem to give a shit about you unless you’re a paying customer, and even then they’re still shady. Zoom is the company that installed a hidden web server on peoples’ computers and Apple had to release a macOS update to remove it. Zoom also is the same company that was slow to patch a security flaw that hackers could use to take over your webcam. And Zoom sent data to Facebook even if you didn’t have a Facebook account.

Spero abbiano ragione, temo sia poco più di un desiderio, sono quasi sicuro che qui si muoverà poco o nulla (i termini di servizio modificati di Whatsapp non lasciano molte speranze). Ma è consolante che qualcuno provi a dimostrare che si possono fare le cose *con un minimo di decenza in più*.

Vado a seppellirmi nelle cronache del Keynote su Macstories.

Stay Tuned, Mr.Frost
